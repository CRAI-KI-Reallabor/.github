Welcome to the CRAI organization! This is the central repository for all codebases, tools, and resources developed and maintained by the CRAI consortium. The CRAI project is dedicated to supporting medium-sized companies in the development and application of trustworthy, AI-based business models. It aims to enable these companies to implement AI systems despite lacking technical know-how, resources, and facing legal uncertainties. Furthermore, CRAI focuses on developing Germany as a leader in regulatory learning and actively contributing to the regulatory framework with practical solutions.

## About CRAI

The CRAI (Center for Research and Development of Trustworthy AI Applications for Mid-Sized Companies) project is a research initiative aimed at making artificial intelligence accessible and usable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Funded by the Federal Ministry for the Digital and Transport (BMDV) and the State of Lower Saxony, it brings together stakeholders from science, business, and regulation to research trustworthy AI technologies, test them in practice, and develop standardized guidelines for their application.

The projects's unique feature is its holistic support for SMEs in the development of trustworthy AI systems: AI systems are tested and further developed throughout the development cycle with a focus on "compliance by design." At the same time, the lab ensures the exchange of insights from the development and support processes with regulatory authorities, and conversely, key regulatory issues are translated into practice (regulatory learning).
